# dueFreertos
This repository will experiment with Arduino Due board running FreeRTOS, the intend is not to generate code but to understand basic directory structure necessary (starting with Atmel ASF examples)

# FreeRTOS v8.2.1 SAM3X-ek example converted to Due
This branch has the FreeRTOS demo for Atmel's SAM3x development board converted to Due based on Atmels Due board configuration for FreeRTOS.

Still missing: 
  USB support (CDC for serial) because FreeRTOS does not use it by default
  TODO: import from Atmel's ASF example
